# The LowRider CNC

!!! warning
    This is for an old version of the Low Rider. The current version is [HERE](../index.md)

The LowRider CNC is my answer to you that want a full 4’x8′ sheet router, or of course you can go
smaller. If the MPCNC is not big enough for you this picks up where that left off.

Size Calculator

This CNC router can handle any length, the Y direction is only bound by your table length.

Width (X direction) seems to be just about maxed out at a little over 4′ using .065″ thick stainless
X rails. I see no reason to push it further if you try it out let us know how it goes and why you
did it.

The Z direction (height) is best kept to a 3″ maximum for wood, with that being said, you can make
the usable z length as much as you want you will be working from the bottom up, so go to town.

Feel free to round up to whole numbers.
