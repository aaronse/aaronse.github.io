## Printed Parts

There are 3 different sets of printed parts **C**-23.5mm, **F**-25mm, or **J**-25.4mm (1 inch). The measurement is for 
the Outside Diameter of the conduit/rails/tubing. **Please measure your rails before printing!** 23.5mm fits 3/4″ EMT 
conduit in the US. Anywhere else you **must physically measure first**.  Some things are sold as Inside Dimension (ID) 
(conduit), or Outside Dimension (OD) (tubing). If you print for the wrong size tube, it's a [bummer](https://youtu.be/RJRHGbYTbU0)!

Hardware store steel EMT conduit works well and is inexpensive; an upgrade would be .049" wall thickness stainless 
steel tubing (or thicker is fine as well). Stainless steel tubing is more rigid and smooth, but also much more expensive.

Recommended Print Settings: PLA for dimensional accuracy (PETG is also good, if your dimensions are verified good).  Two
or more perimeters for through hole strength. There are some steep walls so no more than 75% layer height to nozzle 
diameter.  No support should be needed for any part I have designed.

**Note 2**: The M8x40mm bolts cannot be cap heads, or you will need to grind the heads for clearance  
**Note 3**: Using M4 nuts and bolts in place of #6 is possible, but the difference in the size of nuts requires some 
creative tightening on a few parts. A small flat head screwdriver can usually be [wedged in](https://youtu.be/UAmPhZ7oBJw)
to stop the nuts from rotating.  As another option, here are some [quick print sleeves](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1904014).
