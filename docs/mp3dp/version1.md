## Milled Parts

Material should be under 7.2mm thick, thicker and you will need longer hardware and might lose some
Y travel. All radii and holes are 1/8″ or larger, so use end mills 1/8″ or smaller.

|Part Name   |QTY |Description|
|------------|----|-----------|
|Y-Plate     |1   |Bed plate|
|XY_Frame    |2   |(M)Front and Back|
|Y_Frame     |2   |(M)Sides|
|XZ_Frame    |1   |Main Piece|

(M) Mirror one of these parts if you have a single sided material.

These .DXF’s are in millimeters.

## Printed Parts

I used 20% infill and 3 perimeters for all parts, very forgiving. No support needed!

## Hardware

You can use any hardware/components you want, below are just suggestions. Affiliate links should
help so I don’t have to put a description for each part.
