# Configurable/Parametric Web based OpenSCAD Renderer

Forked/created this area to share OpenScad based projects with Users via Web Browser.  Goal is to minimize time and friction for people to make a custom thing.

Most of the code here is forked/based on Vector76's https://github.com/vector76/Web_OpenSCAD_Customizer, which is derived from https://github.com/ochafik/openscad-wasm.  Check out Vector76's neat web based [Gridfinity configurator](https://vector76.github.io/Web_OpenSCAD_Customizer/gridfinity_bins.html).
